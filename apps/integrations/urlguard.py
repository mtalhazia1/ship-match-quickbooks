"""Which addresses outgoing webhooks may call (guard against server-side request forgery).

* https only, on port 443 or 8443, with no user name or password in the address;
* the host must resolve, and every address it resolves to must be public (not private, loopback, link-local,
  carrier-grade NAT, multicast or reserved; IPv4-mapped IPv6 is checked as IPv4);
* checked when the endpoint is saved and again before every request. The request then goes to the address
  that was checked (the connection is pinned to that IP, with the host name kept for TLS and the Host header),
  so a DNS answer that changes between the check and the connection can't reach an internal service;
* redirects are never followed.
