"""Money caught by validation, and what happened to it.

    summary(org, start, end) -> Savings

Source: the CaughtCharge ledger (apps/rates/ledger.py). Every validation issue with an
`amount_at_risk` (over-quote charges, unapproved extra charges, duplicates, totals that don't add
up, unusual amounts ...) becomes one catch, identified by its document and subject, so a catch
survives validation re-creating its issue.

Outcome rules. Each catch's money lands in these buckets (amounts converted to the home
currency with the organization's exchange rates):

  1. Prevented: the money was not paid.
     a. The shipment was rejected: the whole amount caught.
     b. The check no longer finds the problem because the invoice was corrected, replaced or
        removed from the shipment: the whole amount caught.
     c. The amount went down while the issue stayed (a corrected invoice still over the quote):
        the reduction, amount_caught - amount_latest. The rest goes to 2 or 3.
  2. Still at risk: the issue is open and the shipment is not approved, posted or rejected:
     amount_latest.
  3. Accepted: a reviewer accepted the warning or an approver overrode the error, or the shipment
     was approved or posted with the issue still open (warnings don't block approval):
     amount_latest. The charge was paid as invoiced.
  4. Withdrawn: the check stopped finding it because a quote, an approved extra charge or the
     tolerance changed, not the invoice. Not counted as caught or saved; shown separately so a
     data-entry fix is never reported as money saved. (A reduction from an earlier invoice
     correction still counts as prevented.) While a catch stays open, a rate change moves its
     caught amount by the same difference, for the same reason.

  caught    = prevented + still at risk + accepted
  recovered = money returned after payment, reported by RECOVERY_SOURCES
  saved     = prevented + recovered

Overlaps. Several checks can flag the same money on one invoice; it is counted once:
  * A duplicate invoice counts for the whole invoice; other catches on that same document are
    listed but not added ("already counted in another check").
  * An unusual-amount warning counts only for the part not already caught by charge-level checks
    on the same invoice (charged more than the quote, extra charge not approved): if those add
    up to more, the warning adds nothing. Each catch's outcome split is scaled by the share
    that counts.

Period: a catch belongs to the period, and the month, in which it was first caught, so totals for
a past month only change when an outcome changes, never because a check ran again.

Known limit: when a reviewer corrects a value that was misread (not wrong on the invoice), the
issue it raised also counts as prevented. ShipMatch can't tell a reading fix from a vendor fix.

Extension point: a disputes app (or anything that gets money back after payment) registers a
callable with `register_recovery_source(fn)`. It is called as `fn(org, start, end)` and returns a
Decimal in the home currency or an iterable of Recovery (or dicts with the same keys). Report only
money returned for charges that were paid, so nothing is counted twice.
